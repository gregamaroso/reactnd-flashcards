# Mobile UdaciCards
This project allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

After completing a quiz, the user's score for that quiz is shown. Users are able to reset and restart the quiz.

Daily notifications have been added to remind users to take a quiz each day.
